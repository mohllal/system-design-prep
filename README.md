# System Design Interview Preparation

A curated collection of system design concepts, patterns, and architectures designed as a comprehensive refresher for technical interviews.

It contains my personal collection of notes and resources I consider important for preparing for system design interviews.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- **Interview Refresher**: Quick review of essential system design concepts
- **Visual Learning Guide**: Mermaid diagrams and clear explanations for better retention

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Fundamentals**: Build strong foundational knowledge
2. **Explore Architectures**: Understand patterns and their applications  
3. **Practice with Systems**: Apply concepts to real-world design problems
4. **Challenge Ideas**: Question assumptions and understand trade-offs
