# System Design Examples

This section provides practice problems and designs for real-world systems. Each example includes key architectural decisions, trade-offs, and implementation considerations.

## About These Examples

These notes serve as a refresher and collection of key points for each system design. They are not comprehensive but focus on the most important aspects for interview preparation.

For deeper understanding, refer to the external references provided in each example.

## Tips

- **Clarify Requirements**: Ask about scale, features, and constraints
- **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic design and iterate
- **Use Back-of-the-Envelope**: Estimate capacity and resource requirements
- **Discuss Trade-offs**: Explain the pros and cons of your design choices
